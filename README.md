# Python Package Template

This is simple text for the Python Package Template readme.md.

You can use

to write your content.

Before building package ensure build is up-to-date:
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`

to build package:
`python3 -m build`

This should create two files in dist/
```
dist/
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
